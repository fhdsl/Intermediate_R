Welcome to Intermediate R! Each week, we cover a chapter, which consists of a lesson and exercise. In the first week, we go over the goals of the course, and review data structures and data types that you have seen before from [Intro to R](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_R/). We also look at some new data structures and more properties of data structures.

In [Intro to R](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_R/), you learned how to do basic data analysis such as subsetting a dataframe, looking at summary statistics, and visualizing your data. This was done in the context of a clean, Tidy dataframe. In this course, we focus on working with data "from the wild", in which the data comes in a more messy, un-Tidy form. Let's see what we will learn in the next 6 weeks together:

## Goals of this course

-   Continue building *programming fundamentals*: How to use complex data structures, use and create custom functions, and how to iterate repeated tasks.

-   Continue exploration of *data science fundamentals*: how to clean messy data to a Tidy form for analysis.

-   At the end of the course, you will be able to: conduct a full analysis in the data science workflow (minus model).

To get started, let's recall the fundamental data types in R:

## Data types in R

-   Numeric: 18, -21, 65, 1.25

-   Character: "ATCG", "Whatever", "948-293-0000"

-   Logical: TRUE, FALSE

-   Missing values: `NA`

And the fundamental data structures: in this course, we will learn more about a new, flexible data structure called a **List**. We also lightly introduce *Factor* and *Matrix*, but they will not be used for the rest of the course.

## Data structures

-   Vector

-   *Factor*

-   Dataframe

-   **List**

-   *Matrix*

## Vector

We know what an **(atomic) vector** is: it can contains a data type, and all elements must be the same data type. If a vector consists of only numeric data, then it is a Numeric Vector, etc. We organize vector subtypes by the following graphic:

![Organization of Vectors. Image Source: [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html).](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/eb6730b841e32292d9ff36b33a590e24b6221f43/57192/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-atomic.png){width="400"}

Within the Numeric type that we are familiar with, there are more specific types: *Integer* consists of whole number values, and *Double* consists of decimal values. Most of the time we only need to consider Numeric types, but once in a while we need to be more specific.

Now that we have distinguished vector subtypes, it is important to examine what a vector is by inspection:

-   We can test whether a vector is a certain type with `is.___()` functions, such as `is.character()`.

    ```{r}
    is.character(c("hello", "there"))
    is.character(c(1, 3, 5, 7))
    ```

-   We can also test for missing data `NA` for any types of vector: The test will return a vector testing each element, because `NA` can be mixed into other values:

    ```{r}
    is.na(c(34, NA))
    ```

We can **coerce** vectors from one type to the other with `as.___()` functions, such as `as.numeric()`.

```{r}
as.numeric(c("23", "45"))
as.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
```

This is very common in data cleaning, when we load in data and they assigned to the wrong data type.

Sometimes, a data structure may have metadata **attributes** associated with them. This gives us more information about the data structure, but doesn't contain the important data.

For instance, a common attribute is **names,** which can attached to vectors.

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3)
names(x) = c("a", "b", "c")
x
```

![Names as an attribute for a Vector. Image Source: [Advanced R.](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html)](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1140c34226b3b04438aec65c8fc6b28758d8c091/1748a/diagrams/vectors/attr-names-2.png)

We can look for more general attributes beyond names via the `attributes()` function:

```{r}
attributes(x)
```

Now, let's review the ways one can subset a vector. Here are three ways:

1.  Positive numeric vector

    ```{r}
    data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
    data[c(1, 3, 5)]
    ```

2.  Negative numeric vector performs *exclusion*

```{r}
data[c(-1, -2)]
```

3.  Logical vector

```{r}
data[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

In practice, we often subset a vector implicitly, via some kind of criteria. Here is a [review of implicit subsetting from Intro to R](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_R/working-with-data-structures.html#subsetting-vectors-implicitly). Let's review implicit vector subsetting below:

1.  How do you subset the following vector so that it only has positive values?

```{r}
data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
```

```{r}
data[data > 0]
```

2.  How do you subset the following vector so that it has doesn't have the character "temp"?

```{r}
chars = c("temp", "object", "temp", "wish", "bumblebee", "temp")
```

```{r}
chars[chars != "temp"]
```

3.  How do you subset the following vector so that it has no `NA` values?

```{r}
vec_with_NA = c(2, 4, NA, NA, 3, NA)
```

```{r}
vec_with_NA[!is.na(vec_with_NA)]
```

## Factors

Factors are a type of vector that holds categorical information, such as sex, gender, or cancer subtype. They are useful for:

-   When you know you have a fixed number of categories.

-   When you want to display character vectors in a non-alphabetical order, which is common in plotting.

-   Inputs for statistical models, as factors are a special type of numerical vectors.

Let's take a look at Factors in practice:

```{r}
place = factor(c("first", "third", "third", "second", "second", "fourth"))
place
```

```{r}
df = data.frame(p = place)
ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(x = p))
```

We can construct Ordered Factors:

```{r}
place = ordered(c("first", "third", "third", "second","second", "fourth"), levels =  c("first", "second", "third", "fourth"))
place
df = data.frame(p = place)
ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(x = p))
```

## Dataframes

Usually, we load in a Dataframe from a spreadsheet or a package, but we can create a new dataframe by using vectors of the same length via the `data.frame()` function:

```{r}
df = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("cup", "mug", "jar"))
df
```

We have attributes for Dataframes. The most important attribute is names, which correspond to the column names of a Dataframe. You have been using it for a while already!

```{r}
attributes(df)
```

We can directly access the names attribute via `names()` or `colnames()`:

```{r}
names(df)
```

Here is another example:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
attributes(penguins)
```

Some notes about the other attributes:

-   Sometimes, Dataframes will be in a format called "[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)", as shown in the `penguins` class names as "tbl_df", and "tbl".

-   Row names are not commonly used. Here is a [reason](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#rownames).

Let's review how to subset Dataframes. There are many ways to do it, and here are just some opinionated ways of doing it for this class.

*Getting one single column:*

```{r}
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

*I want to select columns `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `species`, and filter for `species` that are "Gentoo":*

```{r}
penguins_select = select(penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species)
penguins_gentoo = filter(penguins_select, species == "Gentoo")
```

or

```{r}
penguins_select_2 = penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "species")]
penguins_gentoo_2 = penguins_select_2[penguins$species == "Gentoo" ,]
```

or

```{r}
penguins_gentoo_2 = penguins_select_2[penguins$species == "Gentoo", c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "species")]
```

*I want to filter out rows that have `NA`s in the column `bill_length_mm`:*

```{r}
penguins_clean = filter(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))
```

or

```{r}
penguins_clean = penguins[!is.na(penguins$bill_depth_mm) ,]
```

## Lists

Lists are the most flexible data structure in R, as they can contain a flexible amount and type of information. They operate similarly as vectors as they group data into one dimension, but each element of a list can be any data type *or data structure*!

```{r}
l1 = list(
  1:3, 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)
```

![Illustration of a List. Image Source: [Advanced R.](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html)](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9628eed602df6fd55d9bced4fba0a5a85d93db8a/36c16/diagrams/vectors/list.png)

Unlike vectors, you access the elements of a list via the double bracket `[[]]`. You access a smaller list with single bracket `[]`. (More discussion on the different uses of the bracket [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#subset-single) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1169456/the-difference-between-bracket-and-double-bracket-for-accessing-the-el).)

Use `unlist()` to coerce a list into a vector. Notice all the automatic coersion that happened for the elements.

```{r}
unlist(l1)
```

We can give the attribute **names** to lists:

```{r}
l1 = list(
  ranking = 1:3, 
  name = "a", 
  success =  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  score = c(2.3, 5.9)
)
#or
names(l1) = c("ranking", "name", "success", "score")
```

And access named elements of lists via the `$` operation:

```{r}
l1$score
```

Therefore, `l1$score` is the same as `l1[[4]]` and is the same as `l1[["score"]]`.

Here's an interesting connection between Lists and Dataframes that we will make use of later on in this course: A Dataframe is just a named list of vectors of same length with additional **attributes** of (column) `names` and `row.names`!

## Matrix

A matrix holds information of the same data type in two dimensions - it's like a two dimensional vector. Matricies are most often used in statistical computing and matrix algebra, such as creating a design matrix. They are often created by taking a vector and reshaping it with a set number of rows and columns, or converting from a dataframe with only one data type.

```{r}
my_matrix = matrix(1:10, nrow = 2)
my_matrix
```

You access elements of a matrix similar to that of a dataframe's indexing:

```{r}
#column 3
my_matrix[, 3]
#row 2
my_matrix[2 ,]
#column 3, row 2
my_matrix[2, 3]
```
