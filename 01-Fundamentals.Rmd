# Fundamentals


```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Goals of this course

-   Continue building *programming fundamentals*: how to make use of complex data structures, use custom functions built by other R users, and creating your own functions. How to iterate repeated tasks that scales naturally.

-   Continue exploration of *data science fundamentals*: how to clean messy data to a Tidy form for analysis.

-   Outcome: Conduct a full analysis in the data science workflow (minus model).

## Data types in R

-   Numeric: 18, -21, 65, 1.25

-   Character: "ATCG", "Whatever", "948-293-0000"

-   Logical: TRUE, FALSE

-   Missing values: `NA`

## Data structures

-   Vector

-   **Factor**

-   **List**

-   Dataframe

## Vector

We know what an **(atomic) vector** is: it can contains a data type, and all elements must be the same data type.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/eb6730b841e32292d9ff36b33a590e24b6221f43/57192/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-atomic.png){width="400"}

-   We can test whether a vector is a certain type with `is.___()` functions, such as `is.character()`.

    ```{r}
    is.character(c("hello", "there"))
    ```

    For `NA`, the test will return a vector testing each element, because `NA` can be mixed into other values:

    ```{r}
    is.na(c(34, NA))
    ```

-   We can **coerce** vectors from one type to the other with `as.___()` functions, such as `as.numeric()`

    ```{r}
    as.numeric(c("23", "45"))
    as.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
    ```

-   It is common to have metadata **attributes,** such as **names,** attached to R data structures.

    ```{r}
    x = c(1, 2, 3)
    names(x) = c("a", "b", "c")
    x
    ```

We can look for more general attributes via the `attributes()` function:

```{r}
attributes(x)
```

### Ways to subset a vector

1.  Positive numeric vector
2.  Negative numeric vector performs *exclusion*
3.  Logical vector

### Practice implicit subsetting

1.  How do you subset the following vector so that it only has positive values?

```{r}
data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
```

```{r}
data[data > 0]
```

2.  How do you subset the following vector so that it has doesn't have the character "temp"?

```{r}
chars = c("temp", "object", "temp", "wish", "bumblebee", "temp")
```

```{r}
chars[chars != "temp"]
```

3.  How do you subset the following vector so that it has no `NA` values?

```{r}
vec_with_NA = c(2, 4, NA, NA, 3, NA)
```

```{r}
vec_with_NA[!is.na(vec_with_NA)]
```

## Dataframes

Usually, we load in a dataframe from a spreadsheet or a package, but we can create a new dataframe by using vectors of the same length via the `data.frame()` function:

```{r}
df = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("cup", "mug", "jar"))
attributes(df)
```

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
attributes(penguins)
```

Why are row names [undesirable](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#rownames)?

Sometimes, data frames will be in a format called "tibble", as shown in the `penguins` class names as "tbl_df", and "tbl".

### Subsetting dataframes

*Getting one single column:*

```{r}
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

*I want to select columns `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `species`, and filter for `species` that are "Gentoo":*

```{r}
penguins_select = select(penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species)
penguins_gentoo = filter(penguins_select, species == "Gentoo")
```

or

```{r}
penguins_select_2 = penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "species")]
penguins_gentoo_2 = penguins_select_2[penguins$species == "Gentoo" ,]
```

or

```{r}
penguins_gentoo_2 = penguins_select_2[penguins$species == "Gentoo", c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "species")]
```

*I want to filter out rows that have `NA`s in the column `bill_length_mm`:*

```{r}
penguins_clean = filter(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))
```

or

```{r}
penguins_clean = penguins[!is.na(penguins$bill_depth_mm) ,]
```

## Lists

Lists operate similarly as vectors as they group data into one dimension, but each element of a list can be any data type *or data structure*!

```{r}
l1 = list(
  1:3, 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)
```

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9628eed602df6fd55d9bced4fba0a5a85d93db8a/36c16/diagrams/vectors/list.png)

Unlike vectors, you access the elements of a list via the double bracket `[[]]`. You access a smaller list with single bracket `[]`. (More discussion on the different uses of the bracket [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1169456/the-difference-between-bracket-and-double-bracket-for-accessing-the-el).)

Here's a [nice metaphor](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#subset-single):

> If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is the object in car 5; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6.

```{r}
l1[[1]]
l1[[1]][2]
```

Use `unlist()` to coerce a list into a vector. Notice all the automatic coersion that happened for the elements.

```{r}
unlist(l1)
```

We can give **names** to lists:

```{r}
l1 = list(
  ranking = 1:3, 
  name = "a", 
  success =  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  score = c(2.3, 5.9)
)
#or
names(l1) = c("ranking", "name", "success", "score")
```

And access named elements of lists via the `$` operation:

```{r}
l1$score
```

Therefore, `l1$score` is the same as `l1[[4]]` and is the same as `l1[["score"]]`.

A dataframe is just a named list of vectors of same length with **attributes** of (column) `names` and `row.names`.
