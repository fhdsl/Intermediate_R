# About this Course

## Curriculum  

The course continues building programming fundamentals in R programming and data analysis. You will learn how to make use of complex data structures, use custom functions built by other R users, creating your own functions, and how to iterate repeated tasks that scales naturally. You will also learn how to clean messy data to a Tidy form for analysis, and conduct an end-to-end data science workflow. 

## Target Audience  

The course is intended for researchers who want to continue learning the fundamentals of R programming and how to deal with messy datasets. The audience should know how to subset dataframes and vectors and conduct basic analysis, and/or have taken our [Intro to R course](https://github.com/fhdsl/Intro_to_R).
